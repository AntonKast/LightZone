    <h1>Discover LightZone</h1>
    <p>
      LightZone is a breakthrough in photo editing software
      that makes it easier to edit digital photos
      and quickly achieve professional quality results.
    </p>
    <p>
      LightZone is designed for photographers and differs in many fundamental
      ways from pixel painting programs that force you to think in terms of
      pixels or use complex mathematical concepts like histograms and curves.
      LightZone uses a model based on the physics of light and methods derived
      from the experience of photographers through the decades
      -- in the field, behind the camera, and in the darkroom.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <p>
      LightZone has a number of key features
      that set it apart from other photo editing applications.
    </p>

              LightZone comes bundled with many ready-made styles
              that in many cases enable you to improve
              the appeal of your photos dramatically with a single click.
            </p>
            <p>
              Styles are intelligent combinations of LightZone's
              <a href="Tools-Editing.html">tools</a>.
              After selecting a style,
              you are free to manipulate the settings
              of the individual tools ever further.
              You can also create your own styles
              for not only yourself, but share them with others.

              The Relight tool allows you to &quot;relight&quot;
              all or parts of your photo
              as if the lighting were different when you took it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Relight tool does this by reducing the large scale contrast
              and, at the same time, increasing the local contrast.
              This mimics the behavior of the human visual system
              and makes your photo more appealing and easier to work with.

            the brightness and contrast of your photo
            for any combination of the highlights, midtones, or shadows
            in a way that is far more intuitive
            than using either &quot;levels&quot; or &quot;curves&quot; tools
            found in other applications.

            The ZoneMapper tool shows 16 grayscale zones
            each differing by 50% brightness or half an f-stop from the next.
            The ZoneMapper is based on the

            Using regions to create masks,
            you can restrict a tool's effect
            to just specific areas of your photo.

            Unlike other applications,
            LightZone allows you to <em>draw</em>
            (rather than <em>paint</em>) regions.
            Regions are therefore always editable.

            Additionally, every region has a <em>feathering area</em>
            that smoothly blends the region into the surrounding area
            preventing sharp edges.

            Unlike a non-linear gamma-corrected color space,
            a linear color space
            doesn't introduce errors
            (such as increasing noise, edge distortion, and hue shifts)
            during enhancement operations
            such as sharpening, blurring, or saturation adjustments.

            LightZone can open and edit raw files as easily as TIFF or JPEG.
            Raw files from
            Canon,
            Epson,
            Fuji,
            Kodak,

            and
            Sony
            cameras are supported.

            Therefore, there is no need
            for an intermediate &quot;raw conversion&quot; step.

            Additionally,
            LightZone can open DNG files.

            LightZone organizes the tools used to edit your photo into a stack
            similarly to &quot;layers&quot; in other applications.
            Unlike other applications' layers,
            <em>every</em> tool becomes a layer in the tool stack.

            (For example, you create a sharpen tool <em>as a layer</em>
            rather than sharpening an existing layer.)

            This means that every tool is non-destructive
            and therefore can be modified or deleted at any time.
