# Unmarshal Java properties files that have been flattened by

# Usage:
#
#     cat (flat-properties) | lc-locale-unflatten.sh (locale)
#
# where (flat-properties) is a flattened properties collection generated by
# lc-locale-flatten.sh and (locale) is the two-letter language abbreviation
# for the ouptut properties file names.
#
# Be sure to check that the encoding of (flat-properties) is ISO 8859-1
# ("Latin 1").  If it is not, then convert it first using native2ascii.
#
# Flattened properties files are used to provide readability for human
# translators.  They are not part of the LightZone build.
