    <h1>Print quality</h1>

    <p>
      LightZone has high quality color management built-in;
      however, print quality depends largely on the printer,
      the printer driver software, and any color management in use.
    </p>
    <p>
      To achieve the best print quality,
      make sure that you understand and properly use the settings
      in the printer driver.
      Incorrect settings can and most likely will result in lower print quality.
      Pay extra attention to the choice of letting LightZone
      or the printer driver do the color conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the printer driver has a setting for no color conversion
      (typically labeled "Color Managed by Application"
      or "No Color Adjustments")
      then you have a choice of either letting LightZone
      or the printer driver do the conversion.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        To let LightZone do the color conversion,
        select the printer profile,
        <a href="Rendering_Intent.html">rendering intent</a>,
        and
        <a href="Black_Point_Compensation.html">black point compensation</a>
        settings in the Print Preview dialog.
        Then, in the printer preferences dialog,
        set the printer driver to do no color conversion.
      </li>
      <li>
        To let the printer driver do the color conversion,
        select &quot;Color Managed by Printer Driver&quot; in LightZone,
        then set the appropriate color settings
        in the printer preferences dialog.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It is important to note that, for most printers,
      there isn't one setting that will always give the best results.
      You might encounter some color photos
      that print very well on your printer using certain settings
      or a certain color profile, and others that just won't print well.
      If that is the case, try different settings altogether.
      If your photo does not print well
      using a custom ICC profile for your printer,
      try using the standard or vivid settings in your printer driver instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      For black-and-white printing,
      most inkjet printers manufactured before 2005 have been inferior
      in terms of linearity, neutrality and metamerism failure.
      (Metamerism refers to the situation where two color samples
      appear to match under one condition but not under another.)
      However, the latest generation
      from all the major inkjet printer manufacturers looks promising.
