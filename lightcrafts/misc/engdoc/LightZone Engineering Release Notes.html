    </ul>

    <!-- ================================================================== -->

        JPEG and TIFF files.

    <h2>Changes for 2.2, r7421, 5-Mar-2007</h2>

    <h3>New requirements (Mac OS X only)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Java 1.5 Release 5 is now required.
        If you have not already updated to it,
        get it by selecting Software Update from the Apple menu.

          for interoperability with other applications.
        </p>
        <p class="change_note">
          In previous versions of LightZone, orientation information
          was stored in a LightZone database.
          To preserve the orientation of photos you've already rotated,
          the first time your browse a folder with LightZone 2.2,
          it will create a new sidecar XMP file for every photo in that folder
          that's been rotated using LightZone's browser.

          If the folder is read-only, no XMP files can be created
          so orientation information will be lost
          for photos in that folder.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Printer settings are now saved with your work

        Nikon D40 raw files are now supported.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All known printing problems have been fixed.
      </li>
      <li>

        would also rotate all saved versions derived from that photo.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed a compatibility problem between
        sidecar TIFF files created by LightZone
        and opening them in other applications.
      </li>

        Fixed a crash with some display color profiles.

      <li>
        You can now edit a photo simply by clicking on its preview image.
      </li>
      <li>
        The behavior of the &quot;eye&quot; button
        that shows the before and after versions of your photo has changed:
        you now need to click and hold the button to see the before version.
      </li>
      <li>
        Support for PNG images has been removed.
      </li>
