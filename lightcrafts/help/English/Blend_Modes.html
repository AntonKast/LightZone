    <h1>Blending modes</h1>

    <p>
      Most tools can have a <em>blending mode</em> specified for them.
      A blending mode controls how the effects of tools in the
      <a href="Tool_Stack.html">tool stack</a> blend together
      to form the final photo.

      In order to understand blending modes,
      there are a few terms to know:
      <dl>

        <dt>Base color</dt>
        <dd>
          This is the color of a pixel
          before a tool's effect
          has been applied to the photo.
        </dd>

        <dt>Blend color</dt>
        <dd>
          This is the color of a pixel
          after a tool's effect
          has been applied to the photo.
        </dd>

        <dt>Result color</dt>
        <dd>
          This is the color of a pixel
          after its base and blend colors
          have been blended together
          using a blending mode.
        </dd>

      </dl>

      This is illustrated in the figure below.
      First, as shown by the green arrows,
      the base colors of a photo
      have a tool's effect applied to them
      producing the blend colors.

      Second, as shown by the red arrows,
      the base and blend colors
      are blended together
      using a blending mode
      producing the result colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/Blend_Modes_Illustration-en.png"
          width="416" height="139"/>
      </div>
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many blending modes to choose from.
      While descriptions for each are below,
      it's best to experiment.
    </p>

    <dl>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Normal"></a>Normal</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode has no effect;
        therefore, the blend and result colors are the same.
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Average"></a>Average</dt>
      <dd>
        This is the same as the Normal blending mode but at 50% opacity.
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Color_Burn"></a>Color Burn</dt>
      <dd>
        Darkens the base color to reflect the blend color
        by increasing contrast.
        (Opposite of Color Dodge.
        See also: Soft Burn.)
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Color_Dodge"></a>Color Dodge</dt>
      <dd>
        Brightens the base color to reflect the blend color
        by decreasing contrast.
        (Opposite of Color Burn.)
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Darken"></a>Darken</dt>
      <dd>
        The result color is either the base or blend color,
        whichever is darker.
        (Opposite of Lighten.)
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Difference"></a>Difference</dt>
      <dd>
        Subtracts either the blend color from the base color
        or the base color from the blend color
        depending on whichever is brighter.
        (See also: Exclusion.)
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Exclusion"></a>Exclusion</dt>
      <dd>
        Creates an effect similar to,
        but lower in contrast than,
        the Difference blending mode.
        (See also: Negation.)
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Hard_Light"></a>Hard Light</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode multiplies or screens the colors,
        depending on the blend color.

        If the blend color is lighter than 50% gray,
        the color is lightened (screened);

        if the blend color is darker than 50% gray,
        the color is darkened (multiplied).

        This is useful for adding highlights or shadows to an image.
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Lighten"></a>Lighten</dt>
      <dd>
        The result color is either the base or blend color,
        whichever is lighter.
        (Opposite of Darken.)
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Midtones"></a>Midtones</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode is the same as the Normal blending mode
        except that the effect is applied only to midtones. 
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Mid_Hilights"></a>Mid+Hilights</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode is the same as the Normal blending mode
        except that the effect is applied only to midtones and highlights. 
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Multiply"></a>Multiply</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode multiplies the base and blend colors.
        The result color is always darker.
        The effect is similar to drawing on the image with multiple marking pens.
        (See also: Screen.)
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Negation"></a>Negation</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode is similar to the Exclusion blending mode
        except that it shows brighter and more vibrant colors.
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Overlay"></a>Overlay</dt>
      <dd>
        Multiplies or screens the colors
        depending on the base color.
        Patterns or colors overlay existing pixels
        while preserving the highlights and shadows of the base color.
        The base color is not replaced, but is mixed with the blend color
        to reflect the relative lightness or darkness of the original color.
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Screen"></a>Screen</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode is similar to the Multiply blending mode
        except that it multiplies the inverse of the blend and base colors.
        The result color is always lighter.
        The effect is similar to projecting multiple photographic slides
        onto the same screen.
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Shadows"></a>Shadows</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode causes only the shadows to be affected.
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Soft_Burn"></a>Soft Burn</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode is similar to the Color Burn blending mode
        except that the effect results in less saturation and contrast.
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Soft_Dodge"></a>Soft Dodge</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode is a combination of both the Color Dodge
        and inverse Color Burn modes,
        but much smoother than either.
        The base colors are darkened slightly
        with very bright blend colors dodged in.
      </dd>

      <dt><a name="Blend_Soft_Light"></a>Soft Light</dt>
      <dd>
        This blending mode darkens or lightens the colors
        depending on the blend color.
        The effect is similar to shining a diffused spotlight on the image.
        If the blend color is lighter,
        the image is lightened as if it were dodged;
        if the blend color is darker,
        the image is darkened as if it were burned in.
      </dd>
